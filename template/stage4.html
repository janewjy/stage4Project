        <ul>
          <li>Browsers: A program that runs on the computers to display files found on the web.</li>
          <li>Internet: the world's largest computer network.</li>

          Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a main type of documents on the web that glues everything together. Any type of documents can be found on the web, such as images, videos, texts, pdfs, and other web pages.

        <h3>How to write HTML</h3>

        <p>
          HTML documents are made of HTML <em><b>elements</b></em>. The basic format of elements is: 
          <br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold; display: block; margin: 0px auto; text-align: center;" >&lt;name&gt; content &lt;/name&gt;.</span>

      <div class="concepts">
        <h3>Inline vs Block Elements</h3>
        <p>
          HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
        </p>

        <h3>Avoiding repetition</h3>
        <p>
          Avoiding repetition is the essential of programming. Cascading style sheet (CSS) let the coder avoid repetition.
          <br>

          <b>Avoiding Errors</b>: Without avoiding repetition, the code that do the same thing will often repeat over and over, like copying and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements or rewriting the same code (sometimes with minor differences) many times. This can lead to errors when the programmer decides to make a change to something. If they do not diligently make that same change everywhere the repeated code appears, problems will arise.
          
          <br>
          <b>Consistency</b>: Consistency is a key to a well-organized and elegant web page. The same style  can be assigned to each div and specified in only one place! It is also easy to make changes on that style.
        </p>

        <h3>Understand CSS and thinking about inheritance</h3>
        <p>
          CSS allows the descendant elements inherit property values from ancestor elements. Properties that can be inherited are color, font, letter-spacing, line-height, list-style, text-align, text-indent, text-transform, visibility, white-space and word-spacing. Properties that cannot be inherited are background, border, display, float and clear, height and width, margin, min- and max-height and -width, outline, overflow, padding, position, text-decoration, vertical-align and z-index. This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#Inheritance">wiki-page</a> details inheritance of CSS.

        <h3>Set the attributes in CSS for different tags or classes</h3>
        <p>
          The style of each element can be set by assigning attributes to tags or classes.

      <div class="concepts">
        <h3>Variables</h3>
        <p>
          Variable is the name of value. The existence of variables improves the code readability. 
        </p>

        <h3>Assignment statement</h3>
        <p>
          name = expression
        </p>

        <h3>Strings</h3>

      <h2 id="lession2.3"> 2.3: Input &#8594; Function &#8594; Output</h2>
      <div class="concepts">
        <h3>What is a function?</h3>
        <p>
         A function is a series  of operations on input and then produce output. There is a python function example below:
         <br>
         <br>
         <span class="code">
          def restOfString(s):
          <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;return s[1:]
         </span>
         <br> 
         <br>   
         This function returns the rest of a string other than its first letter. 
        </p>

        <h3>What is the difference between making and using a function?</h3>
        <p>
          Making a function is defining the action and parameters inside the function.
          <br>
          Using a function is, after making the function, calling this function to do some certain task
        </p>

        <h3>How do functions help programmers avoid repetition?</h3>
        <p>
          Functions only need to be defined once and allow use to operate the same action with different input.
        </p>

        <h3>What happens if a function does not have a <span class="code">return</span> statement?</h3>
        <p>
          <span class="code"> return </span> returns the output after calling the function. Without <span class="code">return</span>, although the function modified the input, but no output from the function and  nothing would happen. 
        </p>
      </div>

        <h3>Comparison operators</h3>
        <p>
          Comparison operators make decisions in if while and for statements, and can help controlling the function running flow. More details on python operators can be fund in <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_basic_operators.htm">this page</a>. For more details on if, while, and for statements, visit <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html"> this page</a>.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Debugging</h3>
        <p>
          Bugs are inevitable. Don't panic or feel frustrating when bugs occur. Read the error message and trace back the line and function which make the code crashes. Use print statement to separate and observe the code in small sections and debugging. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/software-debugging--cs259">Debugging scientific approach for debugging</a> is a debugging course.Make your code more modular can help reducing bugs efficiently <b>Git</b> is a good version control tool.

      <div class="concepts">
        <h3>List</h3>
        <p>
          <b>String</b> and <b>list</b> are two kinds of structure data. Strings only contain a sequence of characters while list can be sequences of anything. list can be inside another list. List support mutation which means the value of the list can be changed after created. If both names refer to the same list, any changes affect one value name refers to also affect the values the other one refers to.
        </p>

        <h3>Solving complex problem</h3>
        <p>
          Don't panic! Identify the inputs and how they are represented. Then identify the outputs. Understand the relationship between the input and output with some examples. Test your thoughts with a simple mechanical solution. When it works, develop incrementally and test the results.

        <h3>Object Oriented Programming</h3>
        <p>
          Object-oriented programming (OOP) allows the user to build an object or instance in an intuitive way with some certain variables and attributes from a class. OOP let the uses coding in a way resemble human thinking process. In general, when we try to learn from and solve problems in the world, the object or problem with similar attributes are always grouped together. In the coding process,          OOP is a valuable tool because the objects sharing the similar attributes can be created from the same class. If more constraints are needed on a class of objects, then the child class can inherit attributes from its parent class and also add its own attributes and functions in its own class. With such features, OOP can avoid coding repetition, same time and energy for the programmer.  
        </p>

        <h3>Important terms</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Object: structures that contain predefined variables and functions.      </li>
          <li>Class:  a template for creating objects which contains constructor for objects, available procedures and variables.</li>
          <li>Instance: also called object which is always referred to a specific thing. For example, skin care product is a class (contains the functions and attributes sharing among skin care products), facial cream is a child class (such class contains the same attributes form skin care product adding along with some special attributes that only for face), Jingya's home made daytime facial cream is a instance which contains all the details of functions, ingredients and parameters of such product. </li>
          <li>Method: is a function that can be operated on the object. </li>
          <li>Module: is an element that contains one aspect of functions, classes and variables that can be implemented for some certain purpose.</li>
          <li>Library: a collection of modules. </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Abstract thinking</h3>
        <p>
          Instead of considering only one specific object. OOP and CSS both take one step back. Observe and process object from a generalization view. For example, classes defined the attributes and operations that are shared among specific objects. With the features such as inheritances and method overriding for classes, OOP can  efficiently avoid code repetition.
